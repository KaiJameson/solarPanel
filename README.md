###Optimal Solar Tracker Layout with a Genetic Algorithm \
main.py: This file runs the training of the genetic algorithm \ 
SolarLayout.py: This class handles the information of fitness score, knows where every solar tracker is for its layout, and handles the crossover & mutation logic for genetic algorithm \
CityVisualizer.py: This class handles the logic of creating the simulator and processing the images to generate the fitness score for each layout \
